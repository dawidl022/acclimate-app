## About the Application

The app prototype helps users make informed decisions about their buying habits, by providing them with environmental metrics along with an overall environmental-friendly rating for companies from the different retails sectors. The scores come with a map view, so that the user can easily locate a store close to them, which includes color coded markers to make the ratings easier to distinguish.
